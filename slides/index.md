# The kind of JavaScript I like

```javascript
var Y = function (f) {
        return function (self) {
            return function (x) {
                return f(self(self))(x);
            };
        }(
            function (self) {
                return function (x) {
                    return f(self(self))(x);
                };
            }
        );
    };
```

# The kind of JavaScript I like

```lisp
(define Y 
    (lambda (f)
        ((lambda (x) (x x))
        (lambda (x) (f (lambda (y) ((x x) y)))))))

## Software's eating the world, __and__

## (our) _Free lunch is over_ â€•Herb Sutter, 2005

---

# Now, we can only go faster by doing __many things at once__

---

# Threads!

![inline](img/threads.jpg)

---

# Place-oriented programming!

![inline](img/threads.jpg)

 ---

# Shared memory!

*There are __just a few__ people in the world who can reason effectively about __deadlocks & race conditions__ â€¦ They all must be __enslaved__, and made to work on operating systems. And nobody else should go near of this stuff, because it's just __way too complicated.__*

# Alternatives

1. Actors / Message passing
2. Streams / Reactive programming
3. Implicit parallelism: DSL-s, logic programming
4. Event loop

# Alternatives

1. Actors / Message passing
2. Streams / Reactive programming
3. Implicit parallelism: DSL-s, logic programming
4. __Event loop__

^Why event loop happened in JS? GUI!

---

# Event loop

```javascript
var event;

while (true) {
    event = System.runtime.nextEvent();
    handle(event);
}
```

---

# Event loop

* Single thread of execution
* No multiprogramming with shared state
* No locking
* No race conditions

# Event loop

* Single thread of execution
* No multiprogramming with shared state
* No locking
* No race conditions

# The price

1. You must never block

# The price

1. You must never block
2. You must never _ever_ block

```javascript
while (true) {
    event = System.runtime.nextEvent();
    handle(event);
}
```

---

# The price

1. You must never block
2. You must never _ever_ block
3. Recovering from an exception is practically impossible (JavaScript-specific)

^ More on that later

# The price

4. __Callbacks__

# Why do callbacks even emerge?

# Never wait
